Batch Extractor v1.0

Extracts zip files containing java files and places them in a new folder in the parent path.

Accepts a single argument when used via command prompt, power shell, terminal, etc. Optionally, on windows use the exe provided in the release to drag and drop a folder or zip files onto the exe.

If a folder is used as the argument, it will search through all sub directories for zip files. All java files found in a zip will be placed on the same level in their respective folders.
